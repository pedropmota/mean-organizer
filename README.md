# mean-organizer
A minimalist one-page application for keeping and organizing tasks. Developed using the <a href="http:mean.io">MEAN stack</a> (AngularJS + Node.js + Express + MongoDB).

# goals 
- Learn and practice the awesome MEAN stack! 
- Serve as a reference for some implementation details. e.g. using Passport for authentication on an Express application.
- Keep the current version of the app deployed for demoing purposes. 
- Implement the best practices of JavaScript and the Mean stack in a full web application. Please, feel free to contribute with ideas for improvement and refactoring.
- Create a version using Angular2 and/or React in the future.
